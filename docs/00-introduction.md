# Bunchly – Project Documentation

Bunchly is a modern SaaS platform inspired by Linktree that allows users to create
a single profile page containing multiple links, analytics, and premium features.

The goal of Bunchly is to provide:

-   A clean, professional online presence
-   Secure authentication
-   Scalable backend architecture
-   Premium features through a paywall model

This documentation explains how Bunchly is built, how it works internally,
and how developers can run or extend the project.
